Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. 
These creation parameters are called props.

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Image } from 'react-native';

export default class Bananas extends Component {
  render() {
    let pic = {
      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'
    };
    return (
      <Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/>
    );
  }
}

//https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/issues/153
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => Bananas);


Notice the braces surrounding {pic} - these embed the variable pic into JSX. 
You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.

Your own components can also use props. This lets you make a single component that is used in many 
different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place. 
Just refer to this.props in your render function.
