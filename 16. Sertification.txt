Note: If you choose the first option and later decide to upload your own keystore, 
we currently offer an option to clear your current Android keystore from our build servers 
by running 
expo build:android --clear-credentials. 
This is irreversible, so only run this command if you know what you are doing! 
You can download a backup copy of the keystore by running 
expo fetch:android:keystore. 
If you do not have a local copy of your keystore , 
you will be unable to publish new versions of your app to the Play Store. 
Your only option would be to generate a new keystore and re-upload 
your application as a new application.
