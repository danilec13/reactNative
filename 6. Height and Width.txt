Fixed Dimensions
The simplest way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed width and height to style. 
All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels!!!!!!!

Setting dimensions this way is common for components that should always render at exactly the same size, 
regardless of screen dimensions.

Flex Dimensions
Use flex in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically 
based on available space. Normally you will use flex: 1, which tells a component to fill all available space, 
shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. 
The larger the flex given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.

A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0. 
If a parent does not have either a fixed width and height or flex, the parent will have dimensions of 0 
and the flex children will not be visible.
