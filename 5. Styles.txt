With React Native, you don't use a special language or syntax for defining styles. 
You just style your application using JavaScript. All of the core components accept a prop named style. 
The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written using camel casing, 
e.g backgroundColor rather than background-color.

The style prop can be a plain old JavaScript object. 
That's the simplest and what we usually use for example code. 
You can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, 
so you can use this to inherit styles.
